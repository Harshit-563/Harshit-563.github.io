        I am an Information Technology undergraduate with a strong interest in
        Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

        I have worked on AI-driven projects such as **EduTrackAI**, an intelligent
        compliance monitoring system that applies OCR and machine learning to
        automate document analysis and anomaly detection.

        I enjoy building practical AI systems that solve real-world problems and
        continuously learning modern tools and techniques in applied AI.
